Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. The plot throws up intriguing twists and turns at every stage to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.\\n\\nClick here to enjoy all the clips of CID:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzufeTFnhupxZV01Q8X8QVjWN52-tiACj\\n\\nCID Officers ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç Dr. Salunkhe ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ó‡§∞‡§¨‡§æ? | CID | Best Of CID | Full Episode', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pU9XZ96jT3E/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU9XZ96jT3E'}\n"

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare that unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, and fight. A vessel comes flying, and a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol - Satark Rahe will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\\n\\nClick here to watch more episodes of the Inspector Series:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzufeTFnhupwPXaxlzdWOhhlyKczeyYvR\\n\\n2 Friends ‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§π Crime? | Crime Patrol | Inspector Series\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5dA2m3p1TAs/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dA2m3p1TAs'}\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare that unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, and fight. A vessel comes flying, and a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol - Satark Rahe will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\\n\\nClick here to watch more episodes of the Inspector Series:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzufeTFnhupwPXaxlzdWOhhlyKczeyYvR\\n\\n‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§è‡§ï Wife ‡§®‡•á Lover ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á Husband ‡§ï‡•ã Target? | Crime Patrol | Inspector Series\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tAf3rgEMnMA/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAf3rgEMnMA'}\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like how he looks at me, ' 'I don‚Äôt like how he/she is behaving, ' 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind, ' 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol - Satark Rahe will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\\n\\nA Case That Leads Back To 9 Years! | Crime Patrol | Inspector Series\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TL3TwM6R1-M/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL3TwM6R1-M'}\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol - Satark Rahe will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed.

Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement.

The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam.

Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. The plot throws up intriguing twists and turns at every stage to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DDyxSMvtvcg/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDyxSMvtvcg'}\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'.Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P-KedJIWfjg/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-KedJIWfjg'}\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ycyafk0Y2bs/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ycyafk0Y2bs'}\n"

Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam].

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.Click here to Subscribe to SET India Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/setindia?sub_confirmation=1\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/skKwN-_A1Wc/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skKwN-_A1Wc'}\n",

Abhijeet, Daya, and the team under the helm of ACP Pradyuman set out to solve the most mysterious cases and nab hardened criminals. \\n\\nAbout CID:\\n-----------------\\nThe first thrilling investigative series on Indian Television is today one of the most popular shows on Sony Entertainment Television. Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. At every stage, the plot throws up intriguing twists and turns to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pykb2zs86U/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pykb2zs86U'}\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r_cAxc8H9-M/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_cAxc8H9-M'}\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QKz6N9lqY3Y/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKz6N9lqY3Y'}\n"

Abhijeet, Daya, and the team under the helm of ACP Pradyuman set out to solve the most mysterious cases and nab hardened criminals in various different avatars.\\n\\nAbout CID:\\n-----------------\\nThe first thrilling investigative series on Indian Television is today one of the most popular shows on Sony Entertainment Television. Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. At every stage, the plot throws up intriguing twists and turns to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f3n60CPI0QY/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3n60CPI0QY'}\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'.Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lg1B2BDhWGI/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg1B2BDhWGI'}\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/inXVVnqy1Ac/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inXVVnqy1Ac'}\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GQqYgSsWCvA/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQqYgSsWCvA'}\n"

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nqtl6zfHGtE/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqtl6zfHGtE'}\n",

Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. At every stage, the plot throws up intriguing twists and turns to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05RiZKGlUEA/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05RiZKGlUEA'}\n"

Bhopali has a conversation with Shravan as to how he can be forgiven. Shravan and Bunty discuss the matter at night, by the lake. Shravan wants to know whether he should continue persuading Suman or give her space. The following morning, Suman notices Damru wearing a t-shirt with the words ‚ÄòI am sorry‚Äô printed across and she understands that this has been done by Shravan. Meanwhile, Vijay and grandfather find out that Ramesh had taken money from Devraj. At school, Shravan becomes the chemistry lab assistant in order to seek Suman‚Äôs forgiveness but Suman doesn‚Äôt seem to care. Aneesh mixes up Shravan‚Äôs chemicals. Suman sees this but doesn‚Äôt stop Shravan from continuing the experiment anyway. Shravan, in spite of knowing that the chemicals are incorrect, continues his experiment waiting for Suman to stop him. Finally, the teacher stops Shravan and asks Suman to help him with the experiment. Suman later scolds Aneesh, which Shravan is happy to see. Vijay ignores Devraj when they see each other and this makes Devraj anxious. Bhopali advises Shravan to donate blood at the blood camp to impress Suman. Shravan is stunned on hearing this suggestion since he is afraid of needles.\\n\\nAbout Ek Duje Ke Vaaste 2:\\n---------------------------------------------\\nA Love story between two people of different worlds, An ambitious boy from civilian world, who doesn\\'t have any goal in life, where \"providing for the family\" and \"Earning good money\" is the most important thing and a girl from army background, A family where patriotism, punctuality and sincerity runs deep in their blood, Where Country comes first even before family Suman, who has been raised in a disciplined army family wishes to follow the legacy and join army one day to make her hero, her father and country proud.

Crimes that tell us, we need to be careful, we need to be watchful. Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved.Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, ‚ÄúIt should not have happened‚Äù.Would knowing the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving‚Äù, ‚ÄúI think he/she is out of his/her mind‚Äù, ‚ÄúI think he/she has gone crazy‚Äù. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there.In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. Husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there.Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy.Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. May be, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\\n\\nEnjoy and stay connected with us!!\\n\\nSubscribe to setindia channel for daily entertainment dose\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/setindia\\n\\nYou can also visit us at \\nhttp://www.sonyliv.com\\n\\nLike us on Facebook\\nhttp://www.facebook.com/SonyLIV\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter\\nhttp://www.twitter.com/SonyLIV\\n\\nAlso get Sony LIV app on your mobile\\nGoogle Play - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.msmpl.livsportsphone\\nITunes - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liv-sports/id879341352?ls=1&mt=8', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mDIGm98bm9I/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDIGm98bm9I'}\n",

Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. The plot throws up intriguing twists and turns at every stage to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.\\n\\nClick here to enjoy all the clips of CID:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzufeTFnhupxZV01Q8X8QVjWN52-tiACj\\n\\nCID Officers ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç Dr. Salunkhe ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ó‡§∞‡§¨‡§æ? | CID | Best Of CID | Full Episode', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pU9XZ96jT3E/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU9XZ96jT3E'},\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare that unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, and fight. A vessel comes flying, and a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol - Satark Rahe will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\\n\\nClick here to watch more episodes of the Inspector Series:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzufeTFnhupwPXaxlzdWOhhlyKczeyYvR\\n\\n2 Friends ‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§π Crime? | Crime Patrol | Inspector Series\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5dA2m3p1TAs/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dA2m3p1TAs'},\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare that unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, and fight. A vessel comes flying, and a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol - Satark Rahe will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\\n\\nClick here to watch more episodes of the Inspector Series:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzufeTFnhupwPXaxlzdWOhhlyKczeyYvR\\n\\n‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§è‡§ï Wife ‡§®‡•á Lover ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á Husband ‡§ï‡•ã Target? | Crime Patrol | Inspector Series\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tAf3rgEMnMA/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAf3rgEMnMA'},\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like how he looks at me, ' 'I don‚Äôt like how he/she is behaving, ' 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind, ' 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol - Satark Rahe will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed.

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol - Satark Rahe will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\\n\\nA Case Of No-Identification - Part 2 | Crime Patrol | Inspector Series\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GuiyERHbFr4/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuiyERHbFr4'},\n",

The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam.

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'.Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P-KedJIWfjg/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-KedJIWfjg'},\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ycyafk0Y2bs/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ycyafk0Y2bs'},\n",

The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam].

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.Click here to Subscribe to SET India Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/setindia?sub_confirmation=1\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/skKwN-_A1Wc/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skKwN-_A1Wc'},\n",

Abhijeet, Daya, and the team under the helm of ACP Pradyuman set out to solve the most mysterious cases and nab hardened criminals. \\n\\nAbout CID:\\n-----------------\\nThe first thrilling investigative series on Indian Television is today one of the most popular shows on Sony Entertainment Television. Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. At every stage, the plot throws up intriguing twists and turns to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pykb2zs86U/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pykb2zs86U'},\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r_cAxc8H9-M/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_cAxc8H9-M'},\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QKz6N9lqY3Y/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKz6N9lqY3Y'},\n",

Abhijeet, Daya, and the team under the helm of ACP Pradyuman set out to solve the most mysterious cases and nab hardened criminals in various different avatars.\\n\\nAbout CID:\\n-----------------\\nThe first thrilling investigative series on Indian Television is today one of the most popular shows on Sony Entertainment Television. Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. At every stage, the plot throws up intriguing twists and turns to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f3n60CPI0QY/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3n60CPI0QY'},\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'.Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lg1B2BDhWGI/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg1B2BDhWGI'},\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/inXVVnqy1Ac/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inXVVnqy1Ac'},\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GQqYgSsWCvA/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQqYgSsWCvA'},\n",

This magnum opus is supported by a stellar star-cast that includes Uzair Basar playing Ganesha, Akanksha Puri as Parvati, Malkhan Singh as Shiv, Basant Bhatt as Kartikeya and Anand Garodia as Narada Muni.\\n\\nCast:\\n-------------\\nUzair Basar as Lord Ganesha\\nAkanksha Puri as Parvati\\nMalkhan Singh as Shiva\\nBasant Bhatt as Kartikeya\\nMeer Ali as Indra\\nVikas Salgotra as Vayu\\niren Singh as Surya\\nTushar Chawla as Varuna\\nLala Tiger as Agni\\nRiyanka Chanda as Chandra\\'s Wife/ Goddess Rohini\\nAishwarya Raj as Sandhya', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S7VLN9hRsyY/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7VLN9hRsyY'},\n",

Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, 'It should not have happened'. Would knowing the 'Why' behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?' I don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me', 'I don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving', 'I think he/she is out of his/her mind', 'I think he/she has gone crazy'. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there. In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. The husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there. Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy. Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\", 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nqtl6zfHGtE/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqtl6zfHGtE'},\n",

Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police. At every stage, the plot throws up intriguing twists and turns to keep the officers on the move as they track criminals, led by the smallest of clues.', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05RiZKGlUEA/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05RiZKGlUEA'},\n",

Bhopali has a conversation with Shravan as to how he can be forgiven. Shravan and Bunty discuss the matter at night, by the lake. Shravan wants to know whether he should continue persuading Suman or give her space. The following morning, Suman notices Damru wearing a t-shirt with the words ‚ÄòI am sorry‚Äô printed across and she understands that this has been done by Shravan. Meanwhile, Vijay and grandfather find out that Ramesh had taken money from Devraj. At school, Shravan becomes the chemistry lab assistant in order to seek Suman‚Äôs forgiveness but Suman doesn‚Äôt seem to care. Aneesh mixes up Shravan‚Äôs chemicals. Suman sees this but doesn‚Äôt stop Shravan from continuing the experiment anyway. Shravan, in spite of knowing that the chemicals are incorrect, continues his experiment waiting for Suman to stop him. Finally, the teacher stops Shravan and asks Suman to help him with the experiment. Suman later scolds Aneesh, which Shravan is happy to see. Vijay ignores Devraj when they see each other and this makes Devraj anxious. Bhopali advises Shravan to donate blood at the blood camp to impress Suman. Shravan is stunned on hearing this suggestion since he is afraid of needles.\\n\\nAbout Ek Duje Ke Vaaste 2:\\n---------------------------------------------\\nA Love story between two people of different worlds, An ambitious boy from civilian world, who doesn\\'t have any goal in life, where \"providing for the family\" and \"Earning good money\" is the most important thing and a girl from army background, A family where patriotism, punctuality and sincerity runs deep in their blood, Where Country comes first even before family Suman, who has been raised in a disciplined army family wishes to follow the legacy and join army one day to make her hero, her father and country proud.

Crimes that tell us, we need to be careful, we need to be watchful. Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved.Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, ‚ÄúIt should not have happened‚Äù.Would knowing the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the way he looks at me‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the way he/she is behaving‚Äù, ‚ÄúI think he/she is out of his/her mind‚Äù, ‚ÄúI think he/she has gone crazy‚Äù. That gaze, that quirky smile, that persistent stare which unnerves. It is difficult to understand the intentions but the hints are there.In a house a husband and wife argue, fight. A vessel comes flying, a glass breaks. Husband is angry and the wife is upset. That hatred, that ego. The distance that keeps growing. It is difficult to comprehend the damage, but the cracks are there.Feelings‚Ä¶ expressions. Misunderstood, unresolved callings of the heart. The cracks are there. Too wide to be missed. Yet when the heart takes over the mind, the outcome is a mindless tragedy.Crime Patrol- Dastak will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. May be, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\\n\\nEnjoy and stay connected with us!!\\n\\nSubscribe to setindia channel for daily entertainment dose\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/setindia\\n\\nYou can also visit us at \\nhttp://www.sonyliv.com\\n\\nLike us on Facebook\\nhttp://www.facebook.com/SonyLIV\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter\\nhttp://www.twitter.com/SonyLIV\\n\\nAlso get Sony LIV app on your mobile\\nGoogle Play - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.msmpl.livsportsphone\\nITunes - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liv-sports/id879341352?ls=1&mt=8', 'Channel Name': 'SET India', 'Thumbnail URL': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mDIGm98bm9I/default.jpg', 'Video URL': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDIGm98bm9I'},\n",
